Yifan's data visualization portfolio.

# About me
Hello! I’m Yifan Gu, a Master’s candidate in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University with a background in Finance and Data Science from NYU Stern. My journey intersects technology, business, and social impact, and I’m particularly interested in how data can drive innovative solutions across industries. Over time, I’ve developed a strong foundation in programming with Python, Java, SQL, and R, alongside skills in financial forecasting, business valuation, and model interpretation. My professional experiences, ranging from nonprofit consulting to roles in operations and data science, have equipped me with diverse, practical insights. Now, I’m excited to showcase my data visualization work and analytical projects that reflect my commitment to unraveling complex patterns and translating them into actionable strategies.

# What I hope to learn
Through this portfolio, I aim to deepen my proficiency in data visualization and storytelling. I value the clarity that comes with well-designed visualizations and strive to present data in ways that highlight trends, patterns, and outliers effectively. I hope to build a stronger understanding of how visualizations can reveal societal and economic shifts over time, contributing to data-driven insights that support real-world decision-making. As I advance in my career, I am keen on exploring the ethical implications of data usage and learning more about balancing accuracy with interpretability. Ultimately, I seek to create visualizations that engage, inform, and inspire.

# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio of data visualizations! Here, you’ll find a collection of projects spanning various industries, each designed with the intention of distilling complex datasets into clear, compelling visuals. My approach to data visualization involves a blend of exploratory analysis and narrative design, as I aim to uncover initial insights and then dive deeper to discover subtleties within the data. This portfolio reflects my interest in exploring societal trends, economic well-being, and the nuanced stories that data can tell.
