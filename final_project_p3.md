# The final data story
[**Streetlights: The secret to reducing crimes**](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/streetlights/index.html)  

Explore the data-driven story on how streetlights influence public safety, focusing on the relationship between lighting infrastructure and nighttime crime patterns, with Boston as a case study.

# Changes made since Part II
Since completing Part II, I made several adjustments to improve the focus and clarity of the story. Based on user feedback, I focused on providing more context to let my audience learn more about why this issue matters and help me better navigate through charts. This involved refining the heatmaps to highlight gaps and overlaps between crime hotspots and lighting infrastructure. I also included annotations and reference panels on the line chart of night crimes to help signal nighttime and daytime.

Additionally, I reorganized the storyline to flow more logically:
- **Section 1:** Focuses on the critical issue of nighttime crime and its impact on communities.
- **Section 2:** Explores how streetlights mitigate crime, with real-world examples and data-backed insights.
- **Section 3:** Concludes with actionable recommendations for local citizens, urban planners and policymakers.

I also enhanced the visuals by:
- Adding clearer annotations to the heatmaps.
- Adding a light map comparison of the US to show how much it has progressed since the 1950s.
- Using a consistent color scheme for readability (yellow for streetlights, red for crime).
- Ensuring that all visuals are interactive and responsive.

## The audience
The primary audience for this story includes urban planners, policymakers, and community advocates. Insights from user interviews revealed that these stakeholders value actionable insights and clear visuals that highlight areas needing improvement.

Personas developed during the process helped narrow the focus:
- **Urban Planners:** Interested in understanding where to allocate resources for maximum impact.
- **Policymakers:** Focused on data-driven evidence to justify funding and projects.
- **Community Members:** Concerned about safety and equity in their neighborhoods.

Adjustments were made to include recommendations tailored to these groups, such as prioritizing underserved areas for lighting installations and demonstrating how lighting reduces property crimes.

## Final design decisions
The design decisions revolved around accessibility and storytelling:
1. **Visual Hierarchy:** The most critical insights are presented early, using bold headings and engaging visuals to draw attention.
2. **Interactive Visualizations:** Tableau maps and charts were embedded to allow users to explore the data themselves.
3. **Minimalist Design:** A clean layout with concise text ensured that visuals remain the focal point, avoiding information overload.
4. **Audience Feedback Integration:** Adjusted the tone and content to make the story relatable to non-technical audiences while maintaining depth for professionals.

A standout learning moment was understanding how to balance data complexity with visual simplicity. Iterating based on feedback significantly improved the final product.

# Final thoughts
This project was an exciting opportunity to combine data analysis with storytelling. I am proud of this project as it addresses an issue that is tightly related to everyone's everyday life. It also shows that a very simple solution can help mitigate a very complex issues. If I had more time, I wish I explored more into the impact of additional variables, such as socioeconomic factors, on crime trends. One of the most rewarding aspects was seeing how small design tweaks—like consistent color schemes and annotations—could drastically improve comprehension for the audience.

Overall, this project underscored the power of data visualization to inform and inspire meaningful change.
