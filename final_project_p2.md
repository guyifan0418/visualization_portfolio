# Final Project: Part II - Wireframes, Storyboards, and User Research

## 1. Wireframes and Storyboards

### Storyboard Overview
The story of this project explores the impact of streetlight installations on crime patterns in urban areas. The narrative guides readers through a data-driven journey, starting with the motivation behind the analysis, diving into the methodology, and concluding with findings and recommendations. The storyboard ensures that every data visualization aligns with the story and enhances its clarity.

## 2. Data Visualizations

### Data Visualization Approach
Each data visualization has been created using mock data to illustrate its form and function within the project narrative. Below is the rationale for including these visualizations:
- **Line Chart:** Captures the changes in crime rates based on time of day.
- **Heatmap:** Highlights spatial differences in crime density, allowing for a visual comparison of areas before and after intervention.
- **Buffer Zone Map:** Focuses on micro-level changes in crime around specific streetlight installations.

### Sketches
The sketches were refined into drafts using Tableau. Key elements such as titles, annotations, legends, captions, and axis labels were included to ensure clarity and storytelling consistency.

## 3. User Research and Protocol

### Target Audience
The primary audience includes:
1. Urban planners
2. Public safety officials
3. Data enthusiasts interested in urban infrastructure and safety.

### Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals
To ensure diverse perspectives, I conducted interviews with:
- **MSPPM Student(20s):** Represents individuals interested in urban design and policy.
- **Data Analyst(30s):** Focuses on storytelling with data visualizations.

### Interview Script
The following questions were asked during the interviews:
1. What stands out to you in the visualizations?
2. Is the purpose of each visualization clear? If not, why?
3. Are there any parts of the story that feel incomplete or unclear?
4. How do you interpret the relationship between streetlights and crime in the data presented?
5. What would make the visualizations or narrative more engaging or informative?

## 4. User Research Findings

### Key Insights and Observations
- **Clarity of Visualizations:**
  - The line chart was well-received, but one interviewee suggested adding reference panels to better signal daytime vs. nighttime.
  - The heatmap was considered visually striking but lacked sufficient context without a legend explaining intensity levels.
- **Narrative Flow:**
  - All participants found the narrative logical but suggested moving to the conclusion part faster.
- **Interactivity:**
  - Two participants recommended embedding the Tableau heatmaps directly in Shorthand to allow readers to explore the data interactively.

### Planned Changes
Based on feedback, the following changes will be implemented:
1. Add a direct label and reference panel to signal daytime and nighttime in the line chart.
2. Include annotation for the heatmap to clarify what each intense area demonstrates.
3. Explore adding interactivity to the visualizations in Tableau, and embed into Shorthand.
5. Adjust the narrative flow to present conclusion earlier in the story.

## 5. Updated Storyboard

### Revised Narrative Flow
1. Introduction: Introduce the relationship between streetlights and crime.
2. Context: why night crime matters 
   - Line chart showing temporal trends.
4. Analysis: how installing more streetlights can help
   - Heatmap for spatial changes in crime density.
   - Buffer zone analysis for localized impacts.
5. Conclusion: Summarize findings and present conclusion.
6. Future Recommendation and Call to Action
